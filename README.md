# eFitness
Simple MVC app for maintaining fitness schedules online.
Database First SQL Model used.
Project clearly unfinished as it served for practising SQL/CRUD/Scaffolding/Data Annotations etc. Therefore only MVC files are uploaded.
Missing stuff as uploading photos, datepicker for scheduling day, etc.
